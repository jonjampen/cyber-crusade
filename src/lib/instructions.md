# Game Instructions
## Game Idea
You are part of a hacker group called "The Cyber Crusade". The goal of this group is to hack into vulnerable systems and therefore gain access. However, not all of your team members are loyal hackers, there are also some undercover agents among you.

The hackers have the goal to get full access to the system, while the agents try to prevent that.

## Game Preparation
You are randomly given a role, either hacker or agent (you can see that below your name when playing a game). Each member gets 5 computer systems which he is responsible for (below your name you can see what types of computer systems you have).

## Game Process
**Important: You are allowed to lie during the entire game!**
1. You go through - player by player - and say what role you have (if you are a hacker or a agent). Remember: You may lie!
2. You go through - player by player - and say what types of computer systems you have.
3. The player who is marked in dark orange can now decide which computer system he wants to attack. He cannot attack one of his own computer systems. The other player may talk to the active player and can persuade them.
4. If the active player has decided, he can click on a computer monitor to reveal what type of computer system he has attacked.
5. Now the active player can decide which computer system he wants to attack. Repeat step 3 and 4 until x systems are attacked (x being the number of players in the game).
6. The round is over, and one player has to click `ok` to continue to the next round.
7. repeat step 2-6 four times or until the game is over.

## Game Ending
There are three possible outcomes:

1. Hackers win: All the required vulnerable systems are attacked (in the side box you can see how many you have already attacked)
2. Agents win: All the required honeypots are found
3. Agents win: You have played all four round and none of the other two possible outcomes occurred.
